# infinity-scheduler

A fair-share CPU scheduler where the more a task runs, the faster its budget runs out — interactive tasks that sleep frequently naturally keep their budget. Same concept applies to real-time tasks through smooth priority modulation. Built into CFS/EEVDF and RT, no BPF or sched-ext dependency.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone the v2-rt branch
git clone -b v2-rt https://github.com/galpt/infinity-scheduler.git
cd infinity-scheduler

# 2. Build and install (detects running kernel version automatically)
sudo bash tools/install-infinity-scheduler.sh

# 3. Reboot and select "Infinity scheduler kernel" at the boot menu
reboot
```

> [!TIP]
> `sudo bash tools/install-infinity-scheduler.sh --remove` removes only Infinity scheduler boot entries, kernel images, and initramfs — the default kernel and its boot entries are never touched.

### Verify it's running

```bash
# The kernel version ends with -infinity
uname -r                                           # → 7.0.12-infinity

# The running flag is set
sysctl kernel.infinity_running                     # → kernel.infinity_running = 1

# The boot log confirms activation (requires sudo)
sudo dmesg | grep Infinity                         # → Infinity scheduler active: carriage=...
```

## How it works

EEVDF and RT functions modified by the Infinity scheduler:

| Function | Infinity replacement |
|---|---|
| `update_deadline()` | Fair-share slice via `infinity_slice()` |
| `update_curr()` | EMA budget consumption via `infinity_consume()` — the core formula |
| `enqueue_task_fair()` (wakeup) | EMA decay catch-up via `infinity_wakeup()` |
| `dequeue_task_fair()` (sleep) | Records sleep timestamp for wakeup decay |
| `enqueue_task_rt()` (wakeup) | EMA climb via `infinity_rt_consume()` — RT priority modulation |
| `dequeue_task_rt()` (block/sleep) | EMA decay via `infinity_rt_wakeup()` |
| `task_fork_fair()` | Initializes budget and EMA via `infinity_fork_init()` |
| `pick_next_entity()` | NULL guard prevents dereference crash |

No explicit wakeup preemption logic is needed. The EMA naturally converges toward `BUDGET_MAX` while running and toward `0` while sleeping — the budget is `BUDGET_MAX - ema`, always in `[0, BUDGET_MAX]` without any clamp.

### EMA consumption formula

The EMA replaces the old accumulator + clamp approach with a smooth asymptotic convergence:

| Operation | Formula | Description |
|---|---|---|
| While running | $ema \mathrel{+}= (B_{\max} - ema) \times \alpha / 256$ | EMA climbs toward `BUDGET_MAX` |
| While sleeping | $ema \mathrel{-}= ema \times \alpha / 256$ | EMA decays toward 0 (catch-up on wakeup) |
| Budget | $budget = B_{\max} - ema$ | Naturally in `[0, BUDGET_MAX]` — no clamp |
| Rate | $rate = 1 + \dfrac{ema \times D_{\max}}{B_{\max}}$ | Consumption multiplier (fixed-point) |
| Consumption | $consumption = delta \times rate / 256$ | 8-bit fixed-point precision |

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ema` | Exponential moving average — tracks recent runtime history (approaches `BUDGET_MAX` while running, `0` while sleeping) |
| $\alpha = 1/16$ | Decay factor (6.25% per tick) — determines how fast the EMA converges |
| $B_{\max}$ | Maximum budget (2ms) — the EMA never exceeds this bound |
| $D_{\max}$ | Max acceleration multiplier (default 256×) |
| `rate` | Budget consumption rate — climbs from 1× to 257× as ema grows |

**Example:** A task that runs continuously: after 16 ticks (~64ms), $ema \approx 0.63 \times B_{\max}$, budget ≈ 740µs, rate ≈ $1 + 0.63 \times 256 \approx 162\times$. The budget depletes 162× faster. After 256 ticks, $ema$ converges close to $B_{\max}$ and budget approaches 0 — but never reaches it, the true Limitless.

## Tunables

The scheduler exposes sysctl parameters under `kernel.infinity_*` for live tuning.
All values are clamped at write time to safe ranges — the scheduler can never
enter an invalid state regardless of input.

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `infinity_carriage_ns` | 2000000 (2ms) | [1000, 100000000] | Base fair-share window (ns) |
| `infinity_debt_cap` | 256 | [1, 4096] | Max acceleration multiplier |
| `infinity_smt_divisor` | 2 | [1, 16] | SMT secondary slice divisor (1 = no halving) |
| `infinity_running` | 1 (ro) | — | Active flag |
| `infinity_reset` | — | — | Write `1` to reset all tunables to defaults |

The EMA formula is self-stabilizing by construction — no auto-tuning sysctl is needed.
To set values manually and let the physics handle the rest:

```bash
sudo sysctl kernel.infinity_carriage_ns=4000000     # 4ms base window
sudo sysctl kernel.infinity_debt_cap=128            # less aggressive
```

To reset all tunables to their kernel defaults:

```bash
sudo sysctl kernel.infinity_reset=1
```

## Feature comparison

| Feature | scx_flow 3.1.0 | infinity-scheduler |
|---|---|---|
| Fair-share slice | Yes | Yes |
| Budget model | Linear consumption | **EMA (Limitless)** |
| Explicit preemption | Budget-gated | **None (inherent)** |
| SMT halving | No | Yes |
| NULL guard | N/A (BPF) | Yes |
| Work stealing | Yes (BPF) | No |
| RT-stall immunity | No | Yes |

EMA budget tracking converges asymptotically without clamps — the Limitless
property holds mathematically.  No external feedback loop, no refill divisor,
no interactive floor constants, no sleep cap.  The physics of the EMA is the
only regulation mechanism.
